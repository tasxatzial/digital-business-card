# Digital Business Card

A simple static card component built with React.

This is the first solo project from the React basics module of the [Frontend Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend) course on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com).

## Implementation

* Responsive.
* Accessible + screen reader friendly.

Since I've had access to the Figma file, I've tried to match the design as closely as possible. However, I decided to adjust some elements based on what I considered to be the best approach. Specifically:

* The font sizes were quite small, therefore they were scaled to 150%.
* The contrast of the 'frontend developer' text has been increased from 2.5 to 4.5.
